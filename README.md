# Arturia Keylab Essential MK3 TGE
------------------------------------

Modified the Scripts for the Arturia KeyLab Essential Mk3 to add all the easy fixes and the cool features that arturia just overlooked! 

## Current Features (You can choose which to use):

- Fader 9 controls Master(and knob 9 controls cue volume) instead of current track volume and pan

- Enabled Auto Arm

- Pressing the TAP button doubles as holding a Shift Button that unlocks the following options:  

    - TAP + Rewind / FastForward = previous/next device in chain

    - TAP + Context button 1 (The one that Arms the current Track) now SOLOs the Current Track

    - TAB + PAD Bank A = Mute Tracks

    - TAB + PAD Bank B = Solo Tracks
    
    - TAP + Main Encoder In Device Mode = Scrolls through the Parameter Banks
      - Popup shows selected Device and Bank Number and first and last parameter of the bank
  
    - TAP + Main Encoder In Mixer Mode = Scrolls through the Track Groups 
      - Popup shows selected Track Group and first and last track name of the group

  (TAP/Shift can be used as either both, only Shift mode or only TAP mode)

- ### If you have python3 running (should work on windows and mac) :
  - TAP + Part button Toggles Plugin Window (Wrench Icon) 
    - You need to have the windows opened before you can toggle close them (Ctrl + Alt + P)
  - TAP + Save Saves the current project!!!!!!! (Ctrl + S)
