Modified the Scripts for the Arturia KeyLab Essential Mk3 

Current Features (You can choose which to use):

- Fader 9 controls Master(and knob 9 controls cue volume) instead of current track volume and pan

- Enabled Auto Arm

- Pressing the TAP button doubles as holding a Shift Button that unlocks the following options:

- TAP + Rewind / FastForward = previous/next device in chain

- TAP + Context button 1 (The one that Arms the current Track) now SOLOs the Current Track

(TAP/Shift can be used as either both, only Shift mode or only TAP mode)
